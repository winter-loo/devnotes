Let's break down the design of `CachedParkThread`:

1. Purpose:
   `CachedParkThread` is designed to provide thread parking functionality with
   caching, optimized for use within a single thread.

2. Structure:

    ```rust
    pub(crate) struct CachedParkThread {
        _anchor: PhantomData<Rc<()>>,
    }
    ```

   It uses a `PhantomData<Rc<()>>` to ensure the struct is not `Send` or `Sync`,
   tying it to a single thread.

3. Key methods:
   - `new()`: Creates a new instance.
   - `waker()`: Returns a `Waker` for the current thread.
   - `park()`: Parks the current thread.
   - `park_timeout()`: Parks the thread with a timeout.
   - `block_on<F: Future>()`: Blocks the thread while polling a future to completion.

4. Caching mechanism:
   It uses a thread-local storage (TLS) to cache the `ParkThread`:

    ```rust
    tokio_thread_local! {
        static CURRENT_PARKER: ParkThread = ParkThread::new();
    }
    ```

   This allows efficient reuse of the parking mechanism within a thread.

5. Thread-safety:
   The use of `PhantomData<Rc<()>>` and TLS ensures that `CachedParkThread` is
   bound to a single thread and cannot be shared or sent between threads.

6. Waker creation:
   It can create a `Waker` from the underlying `UnparkThread`, allowing
   integration with Rust's async/await system.

7. Future execution:
   The `block_on` method implements a basic executor, running a future to
   completion by repeatedly polling and parking the thread when necessary.

8. Error handling:
   Methods return `Result<_, AccessError>` to handle cases where TLS access fails.

This design allows for efficient thread parking and waking operations within
Tokio's runtime, particularly useful for blocking operations and integrating
with the async ecosystem.
